### Google Advanced Search
  
In addition to using filters from a basic search with Google, one can use the advanced search form. This form incorporates the filters described earlier, but in a fill-in-the-blank table format which may be easier to use. You can find the advanced search form at https://goo.gl/aJ2tJ.

## VM Fusion

How to run Windows on a Mac (without losing Mac tools)

Available from  http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html
Works with OS X Mavericks through Sierra. 

Personally, I think it is worth the price. When I used it some years ago, a major advantages to this software was (is) that both OS X and Windows were active at the same time. All your familiar tools were still available while Windows still ran as an application.

## Browsers I Use

1. Google Chrome is my first choice
2. Firefox is second and reliable
3. Tor is for special purposes where I want to conceal my address

## Browsers I Avoid

1. Microsoft internet explorer

Choices are really about your personal needs and what is comfortable for you/me.

## Ghostery utility

We discussed in class the program Ghostery. You can find more information about this tool at https://ghostery.com/. I use it and recommend it as a way to reduce spam based on companies which track your internet activity for the purpose of sending you targeted advertising.
