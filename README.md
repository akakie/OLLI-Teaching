#README

This repository holds class notes for my courses taught at Osher Lifelong Learning Institute through Summer Session at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. In many cases, the file of notes is made available to students at the beginning of a course. The notes are published on the OLLI web site as reference material for the specific class.

Content of the course notes is published for use by OLLI students enrolled in the course. It is available to others who find it interesting or of use. Some rights are reserved, but the intent is to make it generally available. Further information about licensing will be added later.
